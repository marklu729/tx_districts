## TITLE: Distribution of K-12 Texas Student Enrollment in Three Ethnic Groups(African American, Hispanic, White) From 1999 Through 2018 

## OBJECTIVE: this project will present the number and percentage of K-12 student enrollment in three ethnicity groups in the past 20 years from 1999 through 2018 school year in Texas, and build a web-based dashboard application using Dash to illustrate the interactive Choropleth Map.

## DATA: All the data sets used in this project are public data that can be downloaded from TEA website:
     (1) AEIS: Academic Excellence Indicator System (campus level and district level)
         https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/aeis/index.html

## PROCEDURES:
    (1) Data Preparation: data exploration, merging, wrangling, aggregation
    (2) Data Visulization: distribution of student counts plotted in static and interactive graphs
    (3) Geographic Illustration of Distribution of K-12 Enrollees by Ethnic Groups 
    (4) Build a web-based Dashboard with Dash
